# New-York-Stock-Data
This project demonstrates my work in managing and analyzing financial data using SQL and Pandas, with a focus on SQLite databases and Excel file integration. The following key tasks were accomplished:

1. **Database Creation and File Integration**:
   - Created an SQLite database and added multiple Excel files as tables (`fundamentals`, `securities`, and `prices-split-adjusted`).
   - Used Pandas to read and load the Excel files into the database, allowing them to be queried efficiently.

2. **Performing Joins**:
   - Combined multiple tables into a new dataset using SQL `JOIN` operations to merge the `fundamentals`, `securities`, and `prices-split-adjusted` tables. 
   - Formed a comprehensive table by comparing common fields across these datasets, which allowed for integrated analysis of financial metrics like market prices and security data.

3. **Analysis of Market Prices**:
   - Investigated the highest opening and closing market prices by grouping data based on the **GICS Sector**.
   - Focused on the **Consumer Discretionary** sector to identify its highest values for open and close prices, providing insights into sector-specific performance.

This project emphasizes my ability to work with large datasets, perform complex SQL queries, merge data from multiple sources, and conduct focused analysis on financial trends in specific sectors.
